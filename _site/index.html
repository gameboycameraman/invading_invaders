  <p>Hacking can have slightly different meanings according to the situation, it mainly refers to the act of gaining access to anything you not are given access to. It is commonly associated to an illegal activity these days. In the last couple of years big hacking groups such as the Anonymous or the Lizard Squad reached front pages of the news.</p>

<p>Even though hacking seems like a very bad things (and we don’t encourage it obviously), we believe in only hacking ethically. This would be an original and challenging way to learn about new technologies. Here you’ll learn about how to hack a legendary game from the Atari 2600: “Space Invaders”.</p>

<p>Why Space Invaders? When we started this project we wanted to hack a Super Nintendo game, however the technology involved in this era for the games was in 16bits. This is heavier and the complexity of the rom code was a blocker in our progress. That’s where our Coach at Makers Academy suggested to us to go for a game easier to reach. The Atari 2600 quickly made it’s way in our mind and the idea of hacking Space Invaders brought the team even more together.</p>

<p>You might ask yourself “But why the fudge is the goal in hacking a video game??”, the answer may vary depending who gives it, in our case we wanted to do something simple like changing the background colour. To do this we needed access to the source file. The source file (the name may give you a hint) is where all the code is held, it’s the alpha and the omega of the game. It contains the graphics, the sounds or even the patterns.</p>

<p>In this website, you will find tutorials where you will learn about technologies you may have not encountered before, like hex code or assembly language and that’s the goal of this project: Learning and Sharing.</p>
