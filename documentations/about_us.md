This project is part of our practice final projects and we are proud and happy to share it with all of you.

Working on such subject was complex for various reasons. First the idea of hacking, as glamorous it can sound, is full of grey zones, the most important being:

* Is it legal to hack a game ?

And the answer can be pretty confusing. To make it short if you're planning to make money out of your hack, like copy a part or all of the source code to create your game, then yes it is illegal. If the game is on your own computer or game console and you are not hacking to disable copy protection or pirate the software then it can be okay and a learning experience, which we try to do here. **The goal here is to learn about new technologies**, hacking is our way to do it. But this was only the beginning of our journey, the hardest was to come.

The hardest part of our project was to find informations. Our original idea was to hack Super Mario World and even though it was fairly easy to find forums and websites about hacking and some specialised in this game, we were very surprise to see that no one was sharing informations about how to hack! Everybody was absolutely ok with sharing their hacked games, but no one was explaining how they did it. Finding threads from someone eager to learn and filled with vague answers started to be a common thing and frustration was our biggest threat.

Changing game and platform breathe new life to our team. It still asked us a lot of research but the Atari community was more open to share their knowledge and, at the same time, their passion.
