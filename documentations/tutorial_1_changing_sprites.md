Tutorial 1 - Changing sprites

N.b. The other method can also be used to achieve the same goals, however, if all you want to change is the graphics then this is the quickest, easiest method.
N.b. All indexed text is further information about the software or process, it’s not needed to make the hack work, but you might want to delve further than just achieving the hack.

Pre-checks:

	1. Followed the setup page, and followed the necessary steps.
	2. You’re ready to have some fun hacking!!!

Getting DOSBox ready:

￼ ![](/public/dosbox.png?raw=true)

	1. Open up DOSBox by double clicking it. This will open up the DOS environment terminal.

	2. You can see here the starting drive that is mounted is the Z drive, we need to mount our project folder instead, this is done by the command ‘MOUNT c ~/‘path’/‘project folder name’’

    *In the image above the project folder being used here is Atariprg, which in located non the Desktop. We are mounting it on the C drive, the next command ‘c:’ changes to this drive.*

	3. Now we are ready for the next step, running showgfx.

		*In this tutorial we are using Macs, however, all these hacks can also be done on Microsoft machines (Although you’ll need a different emulator). This step is necessary for both OS’. Due to 2600 gfx being a 16 bit program it won’t run on modern MS-DOS systems, and due to it being a windows program 	they won’t run on Mac’s. This software allows us to run these programs on both OS’, and having found no other software similar it was the only solution we found. *
