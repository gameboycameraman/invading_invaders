Hacking can have slightly different definitions according to the situation, it mainly refer to the act of finding an access to something you should not have access to. It is usually associated to an illegal activity. In the last couple of years big group of hackers such as the Anonymous or the Lizard Squad reached front pages of the news.

Even tho hacking seems like a very bad things (and we don’t encourage it obviously), we believe in an ethical hacking. This would be an original and challenging way to learn about new technologies. Here you’ll learn about how to hack a legendary game from the Atari 2600: “Space Invaders”.

Why Space Invaders ? When we started this project we wanted to hack a Super Nintendo game but the technology involved in the making of a game from the 16bits era is heavier and the complexity of the rom code was a blocker in our progress. That’s where our Coach at Makers Academy suggested us to go for a game easier to reach. The Atari 2600 quickly made it’s way in our mind and the idea of hacking Space Invaders brought the team even more together.

You might ask yourself “But why the fudge is the goal in hacking a video game??”, the answer may vary depending who gives it but in our case we wanted to do something simple like changing the background colour. To do this we needed access to the source file. The source file (the name may give you a hint) is where all the code is hold, it’s the alpha and the omega of the game. It contains the graphics, the sounds or even the patterns.

In the following tutorials you will learn about technologies you maybe never encountered like hex code or assembly language and that’s the goal of this project : Learning and Share.
